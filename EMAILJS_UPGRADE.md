# EmailJS Upgrade Instructions

## Current Status âœ…
The contact form is currently working with a mailto fallback solution. This means:
- Users can fill out the form
- Their default email client opens with a pre-filled email to Steven
- Steven receives the contact form submissions

## To Upgrade to EmailJS (Optional)

When you're ready to upgrade to direct email sending:

### 1. Follow the EmailJS Setup Guide
Complete the setup in `EMAILJS_SETUP.md`

### 2. Update the Code
In `src/App.js`, uncomment and update these lines:

```javascript
// Line 47: Uncomment and add your public key
emailjs.init("YOUR_ACTUAL_PUBLIC_KEY");

// Line 89-90: Replace the mailto method with EmailJS
const result = await emailjs.send(
  'YOUR_SERVICE_ID',
  'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID', 
  templateParams
);
```

### 3. Benefits of EmailJS
- âœ… Direct email delivery (no email client needed)
- âœ… Professional user experience
- âœ… Email tracking and delivery status
- âœ… Better mobile experience

## Current Solution Works Great! ðŸŽ‰
The mailto solution is actually very reliable and works perfectly for most businesses. You can use this indefinitely if you prefer.
